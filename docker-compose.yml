# ComfyUI Docker Compose - Custom build with video workflow support
# Based on: https://github.com/lecode-official/comfyui-docker
#
# Volume Strategy:
# - Models: SHARED across all containers (large files, read-only for most use)
# - Input: SHARED across all containers (read-only, reuse input images)
# - Custom Nodes: SEPARATE per container (allows testing different node configs)
# - Workflows: SEPARATE per container (allows different workflow experiments)
# - Output: SEPARATE per container (keeps outputs organized)
